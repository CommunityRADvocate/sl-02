Click on index.html in this GitHub and copy/paste it into the index.html tab in your Codecademy workspace (replace the text that's already there)
Do the same with the style.css in the GitHub and your Workspace.

Follow the instructions in the CSS file to practice applying styling to your code. When you're finished, share the link to your Workspace by replying to the email you got for the assignment.
